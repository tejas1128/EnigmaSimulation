This is the code relating to encryption and decryption.

The first input called as "pairing inputs" allows you to enter the combination of two character,  and the user should ensure that all 26 characters are entered.

The the next 3 inputs can be called as "rotor inputs", which should be an integer value (It is better if you enter the value between 1 to 26. It is okay if you enter the value greater than 26, it will be automatically converted to that range. But if you enter negative values, the program may crash or misbehave)

NOTE : Check Input and Output Screenshot.
